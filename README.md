# What is NextWeb?

NextWeb is a project designed to answer a single question: What should the next generation of the Internet look like?

This question can be split into the following questions:

- What do you like about the current state of the Internet?
- What don't you like about the current state of the Internet?
- What would you like to experience that is not currently present?
- How should this vision be implemented?
- How shouldn't we implement this vision?
- What existing technologies can be utilized to implement these ideas?

Discussion of this project can be found our Matrix channel: [#nextweb:maple.camp](https://matrix.to/#/#nextweb:maple.camp)
