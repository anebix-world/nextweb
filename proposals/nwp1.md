# NWP 1: The Goal and Structure of the NextWeb Project

- Author: Alexander Hill
- Created: February 23rd, 2025
- Status: Draft

## Introduction

This document specifies the goal of the NextWeb Project and how those goals are to be accomplished.

## Project Goals

There have been disjointed efforts to improve upon the Internet's current design with varying degrees of success. This project seeks to make these efforts known, by documenting our findings, and constructing a recommendation that fulfills our vision of what the Internet should be.

## Proposals and Recommendations

To organize our findings, all proposals should take the form of a NextWeb Proposal (NWP) such as the one you are currently reading. These proposals are Markdown-formatted text documents that have been committed to the repository considered to be the official source. All proposals must specify the author(s), the date the document was committed, the current status of the document, a short introduction or abstract giving a broad overview of the document, and a reference to the document that supersedes it if the status is "obsolete". Status should be one of the following:

| Status      | Symbol | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Draft       | ~      | The document has not been completed, but is open to discussion.         |
| Obsolete    | X      | The document is no longer in use and has been superseded by another.    |
| Proposed    | O      | The document has been completed and is ready for testing.               |
| Recommended | !      | The document is currently recommended by the NextWeb Project.           |


All documents start in the "Draft" status. All drafts must be discussed before moving to the "Proposed" status. All proposals must be thorough before moving to the "Recommended" status. All recommendations shall be moved to the "Obsolete" status when a newer document supersedes it.
